This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a coffee shop sales dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

The analysis covers:

Data Cleaning: handling duplicates and missing values.

Sales Insights: distribution of sales amounts, most popular coffee types, and average sales per coffee.

Customer Behavior: trends by time of day, weekdays, and months.

Payment Analysis: preferred payment methods and breakdown by coffee type.

Performance Highlights: top-selling hours and best weekdays.

The project provides clear visualizations and business insights that can help coffee shops optimize menu decisions, staffing, and promotions.
